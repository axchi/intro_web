            Hello. I'm Mily. This is awesome. I love doing this. I can change the text and the color of the text. I just want
            to do this for as long as I want. But I love doing this. This is awesome! I have so many friends in this club. Truth,
            Emerson, Dan, Brooklyn, and our teacher, Diana, who's from Armenia. Just today, Mrs. Ebeler, our library teacher,
            said that change and our differences are good. It makes us more diverse! I love her accent, too! She also so nice.
            So each time we come here, I am going to mark the date like above.
            <p>4/9/19</p>
            <p>Hello. I'm in this club again today, and we're going to learn how to resize our images! I'm so excited.</p>
