    <p>I love coding. So I'm in Coding Club. It is very fun. Soon we will be able to change the text color and create our own website!
    I just learned how to change a picture using a coding language called javascript! It's so fun!!! I love doing this. I also love our teacher
    because she is nice, slow on our learning, and we actually got to get started right away! I love coding! I will keep this website forever.</p>
